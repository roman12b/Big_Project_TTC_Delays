# Big_Project_TTC_Delays

This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation for our project analyzing Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) delays. The project explores patterns and relationships between TTC delays, weather conditions, and other influencing factors to provide meaningful insights for urban transit optimization.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze TTC delays using historical data, identify patterns, and understand the impact of external factors such as weather and crime. Key objectives include:
Cleaning and preprocessing TTC subway and bus delay datasets.
Exploring relationships between weather conditions and transit delays.
Visualizing spatial and temporal delay patterns.
Generating actionable insights to improve urban transit performance.

How to access the data and run the analysis:
All project-related data files are stored in the data/ folder of this repository. These include TTC subway and bus delay datasets for 2023 and 2014-2024, weather data (daily conditions and precipitation details), and shape files for subway stations and Toronto neighbourhoods. The processed and cleaned data is saved in files like processed_features.csv and delays_combined_roman.csv for direct use in the analysis. To run the analysis, navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open the relevant Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., TTC_assault_delays(Roman).ipynb, TTC_subway_10_years.ipynb, or bus_delay.ipynb). Each notebook contains step-by-step code with markdown instructions for executing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Ensure all required libraries are installed and execute the cells in order for smooth reproducibility.
