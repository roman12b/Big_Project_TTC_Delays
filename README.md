# Big_Project_TTC_Delays

This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation for our project analyzing Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) delays. The project explores patterns and relationships between TTC delays, weather conditions, and other influencing factors to provide meaningful insights for urban transit optimization.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze TTC delays using historical data, identify patterns, and understand the impact of external factors such as weather and crime. Key objectives include:
Cleaning and preprocessing TTC subway and bus delay datasets.
Exploring relationships between weather conditions and transit delays.
Visualizing spatial and temporal delay patterns.
Generating actionable insights to improve urban transit performance.
